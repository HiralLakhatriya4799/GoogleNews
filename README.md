Fetching Googlenews Data for a particular keyword "Cloud Computing"
To fetch data from GoodleNews
Firstly, the installation or upgrading of the Google News package and the pandas library in Python were executed to enable seamless interaction with Google News.
Once the packages were in place, the GoogleNews module was imported, and its version was verified to ensure compatibility. 
To tailor the news results to our preferences, the output language was set to English, and specific date ranges were specified to retrieve news from a particular period related to the US region. The primary search query was centered around "Cloud Computing," aiming to gather relevant news articles.
In next step, running the Python code and fetched data was initially found to be unstructured. To address this, the data was normalized using JSON, streamlining it for further analysis. Finally, the processed data was presented in an organized tabular format, facilitating better insights and enabling subsequent analysis and interpretation of the retrieved news content.
